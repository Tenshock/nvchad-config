# Custom configuration for NvChad

This configuration overrides the default configuration for NvChad.

## Getting Started

First, you need to install NvChad following the [Quickstart section](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install)

Then, clone this repository in a `custom` folder near to `core` and `plugins` folders from NvChad configuration. (It depends when you installed NvChad, usually, the location is `~/.config/nvim/lua`)

Then, you need to understand properly how the configuration override works. Read the [Custom Config section](https://nvchad.com/docs/config/walkthrough)
